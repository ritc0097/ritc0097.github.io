*** Home Page ***

When first attempting to code the hope page to my personal website, I wasn't sure how I was going to go about making the navigation bar move to the left side of the screen when it is in desktop view. I began this assignment almost completely forgetting how to code. I decided to use float to be able to get my photo to stay on the right side of the page. As well, I used flexbox to make the navigation section to remain in a column, and to stick on the left side of the page. I could nopt figure out how to make the tablet view appear properly, however, by leaving it as it, it created an interesting effect where all the elements and icons hover over the photo. Although this is not what I intended, I like the way that it appeared so I decided to leave it as is. 

*** Work Page ***

When it came to coding the work page on my website, this section took me the longest to decided how I wanted to code. After much trial and error (playing with width, max-width, height, max-height, etc), and nothing working the way I wanted it to, I recalled one of the lastest sections we studied in class. Bootstrap. I started playing arounf with Bootstrap on the images and found out that it works very well and required very little coding (thank goodness). By placing all the images in a container, then inside a div with a class of row, I was able to successfully create many rows of images that fit the screen, and is responsive it all views. 

*** About Page ***

For the about page, I took the same coding method as the previous page (Bootstrap) to be able to make the image, and the content react to the different screen sizes as I wanted them to. I used the "col" classes to make the image larger and smaller when the screen type changes, and I used the "text-center" class to make sure the content remains centeres in all screen views.

*** Contact Page ***

The only problem I had when designing the contact page for my webite was when it came to the contact form. Originally, I wanted the form to be aligned on the left side of the page (rather than being in the center). Although, since I was using Bootstrap for this page, I believe I was unable to do so. I kept it as is however, I wish that I knew a way to do it the way I had originally planned.
